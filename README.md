# Daily-Planner-App-CristianB



Daily Planner App - part of Bootcamp challenge


## Description

This Project was created for bootcamp challenge.

It tests the knowledge gained in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, and Dayjs during the last weeks, especially the implementation of JavaScript. The user is able to add text in every hour slots and by pressing the right "floppydisk" icon the data is saved in the local storage to stay even if the page is refreshed. The current time slot is marked with red color and the future time-slots are colored green.

This is how it looks:
